    A Halo Custom Edition mod, new campaign based on book Halo: The Flood
</html>

---

Helljumper: The Flood is a mod for Halo: Custom Edition developed by the Keymind Studios.

The story follows the perspective of the human soldiers barricaded at Installation 04 during the events of the Battle for Alpha Halo, and their constant struggle to survive the insatiable assault of the Covenant and later the Flood; It mixes elements of strategy and terror with the already classic Halo formula that have made this franchise legendary since more than two decades.

This mod uses [Chimera](https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera) as it works as a loader for other 
binary mods as [Balltze](https://github.com/MangoFizz/balltze).
